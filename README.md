# HepaticVesselGeneration
This repository houses the code for anatomically and physiologically motivated, hepatic vessel generation.  
The main branch includes a GPU accelerated version; however, may be more difficult to set up. A CPU-only implementation is also available which is easier to set-up but runs slower. Individual README.pdf files can be found in each implementation on how to install and use the algorithm. Please send all inquires about the algorithm to joewhitehead1000@gmail.com. Please cite all uses of the algorithm with the citation below. For more information on the algorithm, see the associated manuscript.
