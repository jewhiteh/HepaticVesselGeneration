# HepaticVesselGeneration
This repository houses the code for anatomically and physiologically motivated, hepatic vessel generation.  
The main branch includes a GPU accelerated version; however, may be more difficult to set up. A CPU-only implementation is also available which is easier to set-up but runs slower.
